# This is a LIAM2 simulation file.
# This example demonstrates how to create a variant of a model by using imports.
# We re-use demo08.yml and change an existing function (ineducation).

# To run the simulation, press F6 if you are using the editor bundled with
# LIAM2, otherwise run the following command in a console:
# [BUNDLEPATH]\liam2\main run demo09.yml
import: demo08.yml
